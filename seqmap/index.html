<p><strong><a name="about"></a>About</strong></p>
<p>SeqMap is a tool for mapping large amount of oligonucleotide to the genome. 
  It is designed for finding all the places in a genome where an oligonucleotide 
  could potentially come from. SeqMap can efficiently map as many as dozens of 
  millions of short sequences to a genome of several billions of nucleotides. 
  While doing the mapping, several mutations as well as insertions/deletions of 
  the nucleotide bases in the sequences can be tolerated and furthermore detected. 
  Various input and output formats are supported, as well as many command line 
  options for tuning almost every steps in the mapping process. A typical mapping 
  can be done in a few hours on an ordinary PC.</p>
